# Mini-game-arduino

Spaceship game for the arduino

This is my first arduino project, and it has served mostly as a learning experience but also as a very fun experiment. The idea is to implement a fully functional game using a lcd screen, a joypad, a button and a buzzer. For this we will make use of serveral libraries to control some of the components.

## Introduction


## Components

* Arduino board (I used Mega 2560 but UNO works as well),
* 2-axis joystick
* Button
* Passive buzzer
* 10kOhm resistor
* 16x2 LCD display
* 10k potentiometer
* 7 M-F wires
* 19 M-M wires
