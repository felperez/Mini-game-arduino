## Introduction

Spaceship game for the arduino

This is my first arduino project, and it has served mostly as a learning experience but also as a very fun experiment. The idea is to implement a fully functional game using a lcd screen, a joypad, a button and a buzzer. For this we will make use of serveral libraries to control some of the components.
