## Introduction

Spaceship game for the arduino

This is my first arduino project, and it has served mostly as a learning experience but also as a very fun experiment. The idea is to implement a fully functional game using a lcd screen, a joypad, a button and a buzzer. For this we will make use of serveral libraries to control some of the components.

## Components

* 1 Arduino board (I used Mega 2560 but UNO works as well),
* 2-axis joystick
* 1 Button
* 1 Passive buzzer
* 10kÎ© resistor
* 16x2 LCD display
* 10k potentiometer
* 1 Breadboard
* Several F-M and M-M wires

## How can we improve the project?

* The way the sound effects are built implies that the movement of the objects stops while playing the sounds.
